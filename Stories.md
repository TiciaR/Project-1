# With your group, answer each of the following questions:
* Who is your target audience? Pokeman fans

* What is the primary goal of the product? Find best price for highly valuable pokeman card.
* Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
 * As a user, I want find the best pokeman cards so I can build my collection.
* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute minimum product that you need to   pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.
* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:
 * As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
 * As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
 * As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives.
 * Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should not be part of the MVP.
